In Node.js 0.9 and above, `setImmediate` is available.\n\nNote that we check for *actual* Node.js environments, not emulated ones like those produced by browserify or similar.\nSuch emulated environments often already include a `process.nextTick` shim that's not as browser-compatible as\nsetImmediate.js.\n\n### `MutationObserver`\n\nThis is what [RSVP][RSVP] uses, it's very fast, details on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)\n\n### `postMessage`\n\nIn Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer 9+, all modern WebKit browsers, and Opera 9.5+, [`postMessage`][postMessage] is\navailable and provides a good way to queue tasks on the event loop. It's quite the abuse, using a cross-document\nmessaging protocol within the same document simply to get access to the event loop task queue, but until there are\nnative implementations, this is the best option.\n\nNote that Internet Explorer 8 includes a synchronous version of `postMessage`. We detect this, or any other such\nsynchronous implementation, and fall back to another trick.\n\n### `MessageChannel`\n\nUnfortunately, `postMessage` has completely different semantics inside web workers, and so cannot be used there. So we\nturn to [`MessageChannel`][MessageChannel], which has worse browser support, but does work inside a web worker.\n\n### `<script> onreadystatechange`\n\nFor our last trick, we pull something out to make things fast in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 8: namely,\ncreating a `<script>` element and firing our calls in its `onreadystatechange` event. This does execute in a future\nturn of the event loop, and is also faster than `setTimeout(â€¦, 0)`, so hey, why not?\n\n## Usage\n\nIn the browser, include it with a `<script>` tag; pretty simple. Creates a global\ncalled `immediate` which should act like setImmediate. It also has a method called\n`clear` which should act like `clearImmediate`.\n\nIn Node.js, do\n\n```\nnpm install immediate\n```\n\nthen\n\n```js\nvar immediate = require(\"immediate\");\n```\n\nsomewhere early in your app; it attaches to the global.\n\n## Demo\n\n* [Quick sort demo][cross-browser-demo]\n \n## Reference and Reading\n\n * [Efficient Script Yielding W3C Editor's Draft][spec]\n * [W3C mailing list post introducing the specification][list-post]\n * [IE Test Drive demo][ie-demo]\n * [Introductory blog post by Nicholas C.
